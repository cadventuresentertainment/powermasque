# Powermasque
Power through a basic obstacle course with a variety of basic masks!*

Use the Superspeed Mask, the High-Jump Mask, the Laser Mask and the Firefreeze Mask to power through whatever villainous obstacles stand in your way to save the day!

WASD controls, hold shift to choose which mask to choose from.

*Due to time constraints, the Laser Mask and Firefreeze Mask have no functionality. The animations were very cool. You have to take my word for it.

IMPORTANT: Source Code only, it would not compile due to issues we did not have time to sit through and find out why.
